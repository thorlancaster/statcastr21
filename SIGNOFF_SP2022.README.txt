Today is March 12, 2022. I just finished a bomb-ass session of Saturday morning BJJ and am about to go to quite possibly
the biggest game in history. The Froid-Lake Redhawks have made it to state and are playing Manhattan Christian, vying
for their first state title since 1975. (Too bad it's not 1969).

Statcastr3 is currently working as described below.
Everything is fully MVC. The Model starts with the Synchronizr. To make any changes, bytecode is pushed to the
Synchronizr and then a series of callbacks cause the changes to trickle up. Synchronizr's callback updates the
GameModel, which updates the currently selected View on the screen. For the Viewer side, the controller is the
Synchronizr itself, interfacing with the LSD server over a WebSocket connection.

To change events, the App (ViewerApp/AdminApp) changes the event for the synchronizr, reloads the synchronizr, and
updates the Model from it. The event listing table is non-realtime, since the server must be queried to get this info.
Realtime event tables is an upcoming feature I would like to implement soon.

The Admin app (AdminView.js) handles everything related to admin. Touch events are parsed, values determined, and
byteccode modified. The application then updates as described in the first paragraph.

The most recent thing I did was get a rudimentary plugin system operating. The StatcastrGenericApp has a function
that is called from the Synchronizr Update Callback and calls plugins. Right now the SpiritSquad.js plugin handles
displaying scoring runs, a feature I have been wanting for quite a while.

I wish the Redhawks the best of luck as they go against the recruiting powerhouse of Manhattan Christian.
